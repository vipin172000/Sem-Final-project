            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My name is Aayush Gambhir, and I'm passionate about software development and AI/ML. As a first-year BCA student at VIPS, Delhi, I'm always improving my skills in Java, C, and Python. My journey has been shaped by my wish to secure a role at companies like FAANG or MAANG. I'm excited to share that journey with you through this platform.</p>
            <p>So far, I have completed a Software Engineering Simulation with Goldman Sachs, where I gained valuable problem-solving and development experience. Additionally, I have worked as a marketing intern, where I refined my skills in executing strategies. Through this, I've built a well-rounded skill set that I'm excited to pass on to others.</p>
